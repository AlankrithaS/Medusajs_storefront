    <h2>DOMESTIC SHIPPING</h2>
    <p>
      We offer nationwide shipping across India. As our sarees are handloomed and handprinted, each piece is uniquely curated with care and attention to detail. This artisanal process requires time, and delivery may take <strong>10â€“15 working days</strong> from the date of order placement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If stock is readily available:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Orders placed before 1 PM on a business day will be dispatched the same day, subject to payment confirmation and security checks.</li>
      <li>Orders placed after 1 PM will be dispatched on the next business day.</li>
      <li>Orders received on Sundays or public holidays will be processed on the following working day.</li>
      <li>During peak seasons or holiday periods, please expect potential delays in processing and dispatch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ORDER TRACKING</h2>
    <p>
      Once your order is shipped, you will receive an email with the tracking information so you can monitor the status of your delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>CANCELLATION &amp; RETURNS</h2>
    <p>
      Orders once placed cannot be cancelled or returned by the customer. As each saree is specially crafted on a made-to-order basis, we do not accept cancellations or returns after the order has been processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a cancellation request is received before the order is processed, it may be considered at the sole discretion of Swarnika Heritage by Alankritha. The customer agrees to abide by the final decision of the brand in such cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of delivery failures due to incorrect address, recipient unavailability, or similar reasons, any additional re-delivery charges will be borne by the customer.
    </p>

    <h2>REPLACEMENT POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      We do not offer returns or replacements for any product due to hygiene and customization concerns, as all sarees are handloomed and handprinted.

      <strong>Note:</strong> Each saree is carefully opened and inspected before dispatch to ensure quality. This process ensures that no defective item is shipped and helps avoid any confusion later.
