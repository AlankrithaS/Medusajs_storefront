          <p>
            We offer nationwide shipping across India. As our sarees are handloomed and handprinted, each piece is uniquely curated with care and attention to detail. This artisanal process requires time, and delivery may take 10â€“15 working days from the date of order placement.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>Orders placed before 1 PM on a business day will be dispatched the same day, subject to payment confirmation and security checks.</li>

          <p>
            Orders once placed cannot be cancelled or returned by the customer. As each saree is specially crafted on a made-to-order basis, we do not accept cancellations or returns after the order has been processed.

            If a cancellation request is received before the order is processed, it may be considered at the sole discretion of Swarnika Heritage by Alankritha. The customer agrees to abide by the final decision of the brand in such cases.
